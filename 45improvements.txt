Summary of Improvements: from 4 to 5

for 5

I made it so the overlay could be saved and loaded,
so when the map is loaded for a second time, the previous 
signal map would be loaded. I added the map image to the 
front screen. I fixed the color, so it would vary with the 
strength and made it somewhat understandable.

4 contained the location and signal retrieval, the 
webview, the overlay, and the first activity. The signal
to color translation did not work.
